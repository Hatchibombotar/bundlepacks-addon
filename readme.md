This add-on adds 16+ backpacks to the game! They allow you to move large amounts of items from place to place or to use them for efficient inventory management.

Each bundlepack can hold 27 stacks of items at a time.

The default bundlepack can be crafted as follows:

Or if you want to organise your items by colour, you can create a coloured bundlepack by putting a dye into the center of the bundlepack:
